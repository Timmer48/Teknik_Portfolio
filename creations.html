        For my first project i made an arena in Adobe Dimensions. I couldn't
        access the first arena i made, so i had to make a new one in one
        evening. This was the result.

        For this task we had to use two different programs to create. In blender
        I created a lock just because I had a lock on my desk at the time. And I
        finished my creation by making it brighter in Adobe Photoshop.
